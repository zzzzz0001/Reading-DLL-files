This is the raw code which you can use outside visual studio to compiple it.
Slight changes exist between Visual studio code and raw code but the results are same.

Files:
  1. Program.cs
      This contain the main program which should be complied to exe file
  2. Classes.cs
      This could be used to build the dll file which you can use in Program.cs
